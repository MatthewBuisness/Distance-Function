# Distance-Function
A Basic Distance function for a game im programming with pythons pygame over the next few years as a hobbie, Cant wait to eventually switch all of this over to C++ when i bother to learn it lmao.

-In order for this function to work you must define a variable ### FinalDistance=0 ### before the function is written in main.py

-Also math module must be imported
